# Ambient Assisted Living System
# Project Overview
  The “Ambient Assisted Living” concept has existed for many years. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is concepts, products and
services which combine new technologies and the social environment in order to improve quality of life in all periods of life. Ambient
Assisted Living (AAL) represents a great research opportunity in creating new fields in engineering, and Computing. AAL includes
centralized control of appliances and electronic sensors (gas sensor, moisture sensor etc..), to provide improved comfort, energy
efficiency and security system. AAL are becoming popular nowadays and enter quickly in this emerging market.

  The popularity of network enabled Ambient Assisted Living has been increasing greatly in recent years due to simplicity and muchhigher
affordability. Moreover, with the rapid expansion of the Internet, there is the potential for the remote control and monitoring of such
network enabled appliances. 

  Several definitions are available in the literature for Ambient Assisted Living. Ambient Assisted Living is the control of any or all
electrical devices in our home. These systems are designed and purchased for different purposes. The design of such system has many
issuesto be addressed. One of the major problems in the area is that these different systems are neither interoperable nor
interconnected. Thesystem should also provide a user friendly interface on the host side, so that the devices can be easily setup,
monitored and controlled.

  In Ambient Assisted Living, the internet is also used to ensure remote control. For years, the internet has been widely used for the
processes such as surfing, upload and download of data. Now, the rapid developments of new technologies, monitoring, and controlling 
ervices have been started to be served along with internet as an instrument providing interaction with machinery and devices. The main
reason to develop this system is to save time and man power along with maintaining security and convenience.
Ambient Assisted Living is not a new term for society; it has been used from decades. As electronic technologies are advancing, the
field of Ambient Assisted Living is expanding fast. There were various Ambient Assisted Living have been proposed where the control is
via Bluetooth, internet etc. Bluetooth capabilities are good and most of current laptop/desktops, tablets, notebooks and cell phones
have built-in adaptor that will indirectly reduce the cost of the system. But it limits the control to within the Bluetooth range of the
environment while most other systems are not so feasible to be implemented as low cost solution. In our project Wi-Fi based Ambient
Assisted Living system is presented. It uses a PC (with built in Wi-Fi card) based web server that manages the connected electronic
devices.

  Due to the advancement of wireless technology, different types of connections are introduced such as GSM, WIFI, and Bluetooth. Each of
the connection has their own unique specifications and applications. Among the three popular wireless connections,  WIFI is being chosen
with its suitable capability to implement the ALL project. The capabilities of WIFI are more than enough to be implemented in the
design. Also, most of the current laptop/notebook or Smartphone come with built-in WIFI adapter. It will indirectly reduce the cost of this system.


  In this system, we use the Arduino Ethernet model as a controller. The Arduino Ethernet Shield  allows an Arduino Board to connect to
the internet. It is based on the (Wiznet W5500 Ethernet chip). The Wiznet W5500 provides a network (IP) stack capable of both TCP and
UDP.There is an onboard micro-SD card slot, which can be used to store files for serving over the network.

# Project Objective
  Ambient Assisted Living system should be able to control the appliances wirelessly with effectively and efficiently. The aim is to
control the appliances through web.
# •	Controlling appliances via web:
To develop a website that includes the features of switch application. Switch Mode can be used to control the switches of appliances and
other electronic sensors.
# •	Electronic appliances controlled by any device capable of Internet connectivity (Android phones):
 We can control the electronic appliances flexibly through any device capable of internet connectivity.
# •	Extensible platform for future enhancement
The web application is highly extensible, with possibility of adding features in the future as needed.
